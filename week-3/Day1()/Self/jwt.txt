Q) Can u pls tell me in short how jwt works in simple language

=>  Certainly! Here's a simplified explanation of how JSON Web Tokens (JWT) work:


Creation of JWT:

When a user logs in or performs an action that requires authentication, the server generates a JWT.
This JWT consists of three parts: a header, a payload, and a signature.
The header typically contains information about the type of token and the cryptographic algorithm used to sign it.
The payload contains the claims or information about the user (e.g., user ID, username, expiration time).
The signature is created by combining the encoded header, encoded payload, and a secret key known only to the server, using a cryptographic algorithm.


Issuing the JWT:

Once the JWT is created, the server sends it back to the client as a response to the authentication request.
The client stores this JWT, usually in local storage or a cookie, and includes it in subsequent requests to the server.


Verification of JWT:

When the client makes a request to a protected resource, it includes the JWT in the request.
The server receives the JWT and verifies its integrity by recalculating the signature using the same algorithm and secret key.
If the recalculated signature matches the signature in the received JWT, and the token hasn't expired, the server considers the token valid and processes the request.
If the signature doesn't match or the token has expired, the server rejects the request and may require the client to authenticate again.
In essence, JWT allows for stateless authentication by securely encoding user information into a token that can be easily transmitted between the client and server. The server can trust the information in the token because it's digitally signed, providing a secure way to authenticate users without the need for session storage on the server.
